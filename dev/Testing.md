## Testing in Django

Testing in Django is very similar to the regular unit tests available in Python. The Django testing documentation is very thorough and straightforward on how to write and run tests, see here: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/testing/tools/>. There is also a useful set of videos by a YouTube channel called 'The Dumbfounds' here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwypH3YvMKc&list=PLbpAWbHbi5rMF2j5n6imm0enrSD9eQUaM&ab_channel=TheDumbfounds>.
