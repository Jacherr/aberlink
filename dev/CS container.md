# Container for website and hosting

The container is responsible for hosting the website and back-end of the code for the project. 

Can ssh into container using `ssh joa38@mmp-joa38.dcs.aber.ac.uk`

It also has Samba installed, so can connect network shares to it:

`\\mmp-joa38.dcs.aber.ac.uk\joa38` (Your home directory) \
`\\mmp-joa38.dcs.aber.ac.uk\web`  (Apache web root directory, /var/www)

This machine isn't backed up so make sure you keep copies of anything important.

Thank you to Alun Jones [auj] for setting up a container called mmp-joa38.dcs.aber.ac.uk
