# Django web framework

## Motivation

Django has been chosen for this project as I have a good working knowledge of Python and will be writing the front-end in Python so having both use the same language makes it easier to work with. Django also scales very well when working on larger projects, incorporates a good backend database and login system. Documentation for Django: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/>
