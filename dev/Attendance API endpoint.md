## Attendance API endpoint

Currently waiting for the API to be setup for sending a request to update a students attendance. Will leave for a few weeks and then contact Leslie Johns [lej] if there is no response.

Below is an example of the JSON objects which will be sent and recieved from the API endpoint:
```json
# Request
{
    “username” : “joa38”
}

# Response
{
    “status_updated” : ”true”,
    “request” : “200”, 
    “module_code”:”CS32120”
 }
```

Thank you to Leslie Jones [lej] for setting this up.
