\textbf{Please provide a brief summary of your project (150 word max)}\\
I'm creating a system that links student's discord accounts to their uni accounts. This is done through a website that allows users to log in with their Discord accounts and their student account using Discords login system and OpenID Connect respectively so no password information is ever stored. This information is then saved in a backend postgresql database stored in the Department of Computer Science's servers so it is
protected from remote attacks. A discord bot is then used on the front end to verify if a student has a verified Discord account and what student account that is linked to. It is also responsible for marking students' attendance in practicals. 

\textbf{I can confirm that the study does not involve vulnerable participants including participants under the age of 18, those with learning/communication or associated difficulties or those that are otherwise unable to provide informed consent?}\\
