\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}

I'd like to thank Dan Monaghan for giving me the original inspiration for this project and for helping me along the way with understanding key concepts. 

I am grateful to have been working along side Dr. Neal Snooke for this project. Over the last year we have worked collaboratively on multiple Discord bots and improved the Uni's online Discord presence. I'd also like to thank him for allowing me to re-create and use the Discord bots that he created and have been the main motivation behind this project.

I'd like to thank Alun Jones for his continued support throughout this project and his resourcefulness in providing instructions on how to setup and use specific uni services.

I'd like to thank Leslie Johns for having setup an API endpoint that has been crucial in getting this project off the ground. He was very fast at setting this up and provided good documentation along with testing links which have helped in the testing section of this document.
