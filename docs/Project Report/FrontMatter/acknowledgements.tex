\textbf{Mr. Dan Monaghan} - for giving me the original inspiration for this project and for helping me along the way with understanding key concepts. 

\textbf{Dr. Neal Snooke} - for collaborating with me on multiple Discord bots and improve the unis online Discord presence. His bots were main motivation behind this project and I'd like to thank him for allowing me to re-create them for this project.

\textbf{Dr. Alun Jones} - for his continued support throughout this project and his resourcefulness in providing instructions on how to setup and use  uni services for this project.

\textbf{Mr. Leslie Johns} - for having setup the API endpoint for student attendance that has been crucial in getting this project off the ground.

\textbf{My family and friends} - for providing support and helping me get through university. A special thank you to everyone in the Comp Sci After Dark Discord server for being a great group of people and friends. 

\textbf{Dr. Angharad Shaw, Mr. Chris Loftus and the Computer Science Department} - for helping to populate the Comp Sci Community Hub which is what lead to the unis online Discord presence, without which wouldn't have lead to the creation of Neal Snooke's bots. A special thank you to Chris Loftus for acknowledging my work on DemoHelper and turning it into a job that inspired me to work on more Discord bots and the eventual creation of AberLink.
