AberLink contains 2 components; this website which is used to link up discord accounts to students' accounts and a Discord bot called AberLink that is used for verifying students' Discord accounts. This bot is also responsible for marking students' attendance during practicals that have the flag of "Discord" on their student record.

The AberLink Discord bot is based off of two previous bots called Aber Verify Bot \textbf{NEED LINK HERE} and I am here! \textbf{NEED LINK HERE}. These bots veirfied students' Discord accounts and helped to mark attendance during practicals respectively but have been greatly modified.
