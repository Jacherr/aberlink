\section*{\centering Abstract}

AberLink contains 2 components; a website which is used to link up Discord \cite{discord} accounts to students' accounts and a Discord bot called AberLink that is used for verifying students' Discord accounts. This bot is also responsible for marking students' attendance during practicals that have the flag of "Discord" on their student record.

This system was developed on the Linux distribution Debian 10 (Buster) \cite{debian}. It uses the open source HTTP server Apache2.0 \cite{apache2} to web-host along with the Python framework Django \cite{Django} for the website. The website is locked behind the Open-ID Connect \cite{OpenID} login system that only authenticates users with Aber accounts. Once logged in a user can link multiple Discord accounts to their Aber account. 

Information is saved to a back-end  PostgreSQL \cite{psql} database using primary keys to link the university and Discord accounts together. The Discord bot (AberLink) using the Python library Discord.py \cite{discord.py} then verifies Discord accounts by checking if that account is present in the database and then grant users access to the Discord server. AberLink also has an API endpoint for marking attendance on Student Record and uses the database to perform a reverse search on Discord users to get their university information and send that to the endpoint.

The AberLink Discord bot is based on two previous bots called Aber Verify Bot \cite{aber_verify} and I am here! \cite{i_am_here}, both created my Neal Snooke. These bots verified students' Discord accounts and helped to mark attendance during practicals respectively. AberLink greatly modifies the original implementation of these bots to use a proper back-end database and an API to update attendance.
