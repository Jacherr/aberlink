<h2>What is AberLink?</h2>
<p>AberLink is a software service that connects Discord accounts to Aberystwyth University accounts using OpenID
    Connect. There is currently a website hosted on <a href="https://mmp-joa38.dcs.aber.ac.uk/">https://mmp-joa38.dcs.aber.ac.uk/</a> that acts as the temporary webite for the
    login system. From the website users can monitor which university servers they are in. This project will also contain a
    front-end Discord bot to verify users and monitor attendance.
</p>
<p>
    A website will be created called discord.dcs.aber.ac.uk and will be built using the Python
    Django framework and can be accessed using OpenID Connect login system. After the user
    signs in for the first time they will be requested to sign in with Discord using OAuth2 to link
    their accounts together (this only happens once). Their uni email and Discord account will be
    saved in a relational database using PostgreSQL (PSQL) and stored there for use in the bot.
    The website will offer a dashboard that displays information on the servers that the user
    is currently in (module servers only) by using the bot to cross check if the user’s Discord ID
    exists in a specific server. If the user is not present inside of a module server the bot will create
    an invite link and make a clickable hyperlink on the website for the student to use to join the
    server. If the logged-in user is a lecturer then they will be able to see the servers for which they
    have an administrative role and view all the users that are currently in those servers. There
    will also be an interface for lecturers to provision module servers where they can remove any
    of last year’s students, all the channels and re-create fresh channels or create a new server
    entirely using a server template.
</p>
<p>
    This project builds on the Discord bots ’AberVerify’ and ’I am here’ by integrating
    them into a singular bot in Python using the Discord.py library. The ’AberVerify’ bot is
    responsible for verifying the identity of students in Discord by cross checking their IDs with
    their aber.ac.uk email addresses. The new system will use a PSQL database to check if a Discord
    user’s ID exists and give them the verified role once they join the server. The ’I am here’
    bot is responsible for acknowledging the attendance of a student in a practical by having the
    student type a command in Discord and the bot will send an email to the lecturer containing
    the student’s email. The new system will wait until the student sends the command to confirm
    their presence in the practical and then send the request to the university servers to mark
    the student as present during the practical. It will also send them a DM on Discord with a
    timestamp and module code as a confirmation receipt of the update.
</p>
<p>
    The end goal of this project is to provide a piece of software that can be run and maintained
    by the DCS easily and used for Discord servers in the foreseeable future. Therefore the project
    will have substantially more documentation to explain how each component of the software
    works.
