<h2>Usability Study Participation Agreement: FORM B</h2>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
    Thank you for agreeing to participate in my user evaluation study for my undergraduate dissertation project:
    <strong>Discord bot for verification and attendance linked to OpenID Connect</strong>. This is for the module
    CS39440 Major Project as part of my <strong>GG4R Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence</strong> degree at
    Aberystwyth University.
</p>
<p>
    The aim of this study is to create a system that links student's discord accounts to their uni accounts. This is
    done through a website that allows users to log in with their Discord accounts and their student account using
    Discords login system and OpenID Connect respectively so no password information is ever stored. The information is
    then saved in a PostgreSQL database stored in the Department of Computer Science's servers so it is protected from
    remote attacks. A Discord bot is then used on the front end to verify if a student has a verified Discord account
    and what student account that is linked to. It is also responsible for marking students' attendance in practicals.
</p>

<h4>Confidentiality</h4>
<p>
    I, <strong>Joel Adams</strong>, will keep all responses securely. I will retain the signed consent forms. These will
    not be shared with the University unless I am required to do so to demonstrate that appropriate consent was
    gathered.
</p>
<p>
    The data that is gathered during this study will be analysed and used in relevant sections of my dissertation.
    Copies of the raw response, without any analysis, will be provided in an appendix in my report, as evidence that I
    have conducted this study. However, the data will be checked and anonymised before it is included in the report.
</p>
<p>
    The reports are read by members of staff in the University as part of the assessment process. Typically, this will
    mean approximately 3 members of staff. An external examiner from another University might also read the report.
    The original data completed by participants will be deleted when the module result is released in June/July 2021.
</p>

<h4>Withdrawal of Consent</h4>
<p>
    You are entitled to withdraw your consent to use your evaluation as part of the study. The analysis will be
    completed and submitted as part of my work by <strong>Friday 30th April</strong>. The report will be printed and
    bound up to three days earlier. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact me by <strong>12noon on Tuesday
        27th April</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    The department keeps reports for approximately 1 year and might be shared with other students and members of staff
    as an example of work from this year. If you wish to withdraw your consent after the document has been sent for
    binding and submission, it would be possible to request that the project is not used for any purpose other than
    assessment, therefore limiting the number of readers.
    Viewing the Analysis
