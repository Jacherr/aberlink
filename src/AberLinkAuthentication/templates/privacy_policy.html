    <strong>Please provide a brief summary of your project (150 word max)</strong><br>
    I'm creating a system that links student's discord accounts to their uni accounts. This is
    done through a website that allows users to log in with their Discord accounts and their
    student account using Discords login system and OpenID Connect respectively so no
    password information is ever stored. This information is then saved in a backend
    postgresql database stored in the Department of Computer Science's servers so it is
    protected from remote attacks. A discord bot is then used on the front end to verify if a
    student has a verified Discord account and what student account that is linked to. It is
    also responsible for marking students' attendance in practicals.<br>
    <strong>I can confirm that the study does not involve vulnerable participants including
        participants under the age of 18, those with learning/communication or associated

        how it shall be used during and after the study). Participants will also be given time
        to consider whether they wish to take part in the study and be given the right to
        withdraw at any given time.</strong><br>
    Yes<br>
    <strong>I can confirm that there is no risk that the nature of the research topic might lead to

        activities or other activities that represent a risk to themselves or others (e.g. sexual
        activity, drug use or professional misconduct).</strong><br>
    Yes<br>
    <strong>I can confirm that the study will not induce stress, anxiety, lead to humiliation or
